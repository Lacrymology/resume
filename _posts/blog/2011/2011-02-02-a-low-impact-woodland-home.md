[Simon Dale's hobbit-home](http://www.beingsomewhere.net/hobbit.htm) was built with reused materials and fallen timbers, for approximately $4,500. The reciprocal roof is brilliant, strong enough to support a "living roof" and reportedly easy to build. Simon built the home himself, with a little help from friends and family, spending 1000-1500 man-hours.
