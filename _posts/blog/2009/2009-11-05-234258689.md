The instructions below should work for *all* versions of Mac OS X. YMMV. You may substitute .profile for .bash_profile. Older versions of Mac OS X may need to substitute "nano" for "pico".
	nano ~/.bash_profile
Add or edit the PATH line to get "cake bake ..." working within your app/ directory:
	PATH="$PATH:../cake/console/"
If you want "cake ..." to work *anywhere* in the filesystem, download and install CakePHP to ~/Sites/cakephp. Then add or edit the PATH line like so:
	PATH="$PATH:/Users/username/Sites/cakephp/cake/console/"
