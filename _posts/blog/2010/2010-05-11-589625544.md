<img src="/assets/150px-IgnatiusLaconi.jpg" alt="Saint Ignatius of Laconi" style="float: right; padding-left: 1em;" /> Ignatius was the son of a poor farmer in Laconi, Italy. He was born on December 17, 1701. When he was about seventeen, he became very ill. He promised to become a Franciscan if he would get better. But when the illness left him, his father convinced him to wait. A couple of years later, Ignatius was almost killed when he lost control of his horse. Suddenly, however, the horse stopped and trotted on quietly. Ignatius was convinced that God had saved his life. He made up his mind to follow his religious vocation at once, and he joined the Franciscans. Brother Ignatius never held any important position in the Franciscan Order. For fifteen years he worked as a weaver. Then for forty years he carried out the task of asking for donations. He went from house to house requesting food and offerings to support the friars. Ignatius visited families and received their gifts. But the people soon realized that they received a gift in return. Brother Ignatius consoled the sick and cheered up the lonely. He made peace between enemies, converted people hardened by sin, and advised those in trouble. The people began to wait for his visits. There were some difficult days too. Once in a while, a door was slammed in his face, and often the weather was bad. Always, there were miles and miles to walk. But Ignatius remained kind and faithful. He died at the age of eighty, on May 11, 1781. Ignatius was proclaimed a saint by Pope Pius XII in 1951.
