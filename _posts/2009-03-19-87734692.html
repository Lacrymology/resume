<p>My friend Kevin has written a letter which strikes some common notes with [my response](http://www.disinnovate.com/post/87029902/endlessly-meaningless-justification) to my friend [Matt Edmund](http://linxsan.vox.com/library/post/i-see-say-the-blind-man-where-the-end-always-justifies-the-means.html). I'll have more to say later, but for now, a [link to Kevin's letter](http://www.thelastmartyrdom.com/index.cfm?load=page&page=632) and an excerpt will have to suffice:<br />
> "This, rather, is the fasting that I wish: releasing those bound unjustly, untying the thongs of the yoke; Setting free the oppressed, breaking every yoke; Sharing your bread with the hungry, sheltering the oppressed and the homeless; Clothing the naked when you see them, and not turning your back on your own." ([Isaiah 58:6-7](http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/isaiah/isaiah58.htm#v6))<br />
><br />
> It is not always within our power to defend those unjustly prosecuted, free those unjustly persecuted, or overturn unjust laws. It is not always within our power to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and shelter the homeless. Yet it is always within our power to free souls from our condemnation of them, our inordinate criticism of them, our obsession with conspiracies and controversies, or our general lack of concern. It is always within our power ... to love others (to truly love them), to take into consideration their circumstance, to seek common ground and solidarity with them, and to pray to the Father to forgive them of their sins, for they know not what they do. This is the yoke we can untie and break, the bread we can bestow, and the oppression we can remove from their midst. (Kevin Francis Bernadette Clay: [Letter From the Superior General #6](http://www.thelastmartyrdom.com/index.cfm?load=page&page=636))</p>
