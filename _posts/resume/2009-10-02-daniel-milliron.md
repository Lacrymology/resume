Michael is one of those rare combinations of brilliant engineer and business visionary.  He stays on top of both the technical and business sides of the Internet industry.  Michael excels at software engineering, but can just as easily guide product direction, and can help non-technical business developers leverage the most of their technology assets and potential.

I have worked with Michael for over half a decade and have always been impressed and inspired.  I would work with him again in a heartbeat!
