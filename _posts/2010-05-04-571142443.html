<p>		Brighid's latest drawing of Jesus. She drew Him of her own volition, without any assistance of any kind. Note the crucifixion pose and the Eucharistic host. I crossed myself and said a short prayer when Shannan first showed it to me. Glory be to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, our three-year-old daughter understands the mystery of [Christ's Living Sacrifice in the Eucharist](http://www.catholic.com/library/Institution_of_the_Mass.asp) better than I do!</p>
<p>> Out of the mouths of infants and nurslings you have brought forth praise.</p>
<p>&mdash; [Matthew 21:16](http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/matthew/matthew21.htm#v16) (NAB)</p>
