I'm hacking away at an interactive genealogy chart for my family. Not looking to reinvent the wheel, I found two promising tools:
* The [Google Visualization API](http://goo.gl/qOD2v) "allows you to create visualizations and reporting applications over structured data and helps integrate these directly into your website or on a Gadget."
* The [JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit](http://thejit.org/demos/) "provides tools for creating Interactive Data Visualizations for the Web."
