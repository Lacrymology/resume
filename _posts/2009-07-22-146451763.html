<p>> Can there be peace with the caste system? Can there be peace when you do not recognize your brother as your equal? Mahatma Gandhi freed India from British imperialism, but that liberation has not been completed yet. Gandhi represented universality, an absolutely Christian idea. If he had lived longer he would have abolished the castes, child marriage, the dowry system, bride burning. ... India must free itself of all these evils, as well as from fundamentalists.</p>
<p>&mdash; His Eminence Cardinal Telesphore Toppo, Archbishop of Ranchi. via <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/vnews/getstory.asp?number=96085">EWTN</a>.</p>
