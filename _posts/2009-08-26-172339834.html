<p>A typical process for public-facing production servers. Tested in i386 and x86_64 environments.<br />
Basic security protocol suggests no compilers or headers are available on public-facing servers*. Install missing compilers, headers:</p>
<p>    yum install gcc make libxml2-devel</p>
<p>Install the libxml-ruby gem:</p>
<p>    gem install libxml-ruby --no-rdoc --no-ri</p>
<p>Remove compilers, headers and their dependencies:</p>
<p>    yum erase gcc binutils cpp glibc-devel glibc-headers kernel-headers libgomp libxml2-devel pkgconfig zlib-devel make</p>
<p>\* Many years working in e-commerce, fending off various attacks and threats, has nurtured a healthy sense of caution. Do *not* leave unused compilers and headers installed on public-facing machines.</p>
