<p><img src="/assets/anab.jpg" alt="Blessed Anne Garcia" style="float: right; padding-left: 1em;" /> Anne, the daughter of peasants, was born in Almendral, Spain, in 1549. She took care of sheep until she was twenty years old. Four miles from her hometown was Avila, the city where St. Teresa and her Carmelite nuns lived. Anne wanted to be a nun too, and St. Teresa accepted her into the monastery. Anne became a lay sister instead of a cloistered nun. This meant that Sister Anne could go out and do the errands while the other nuns who stayed home prayed. For the last six years of her life, St. Teresa chose Sister Anne to be her traveling companion and secre- tary. St. Teresa went around to visit the communities of Carmelite nuns. Sometimes she started a new convent. Sometimes she helped the nuns become more enthusiastic about the wonderful life they had chosen. St. Teresa thought very highly of Sister Anne and praised her to the other nuns. Although Sister Anne never had the chance to go to school, she knew how to read and write. She recorded her experiences with the great St. Teresa. It was Sister Anne who was with her when she died. Sister Anne’s life continued quite normally for six years after St. Teresa’s death. Then the superiors decided to open a new convent in Paris, France. Five nuns were selected to go and Sister Anne was one of them. While the people of Paris were warmly greeting the nuns, Sister Anne slipped into the kitchen and prepared a meal for her hungry sisters. Eventually, four of the five nuns moved on to the Netherlands. Sister Anne remained behind in France because she had been appointed the prioress or superior. Considering herself unworthy of this office, she reminded the Lord that most of the young French women joining their community were from rich, noble families. She was only a shepherdess. Within her heart, Sister Anne heard the Lord’s answer: ”With straws I light my fire.” Sister Anne was later sent to the Netherlands to start more new convents. She went first to Mons and then to Antwerp. The young women who came to join the Carmelites thought of Sister Anne as a saint. Sister Anne died in Antwerp in 1626. She was proclaimed “blessed” by Pope Benedict XV.<br />
