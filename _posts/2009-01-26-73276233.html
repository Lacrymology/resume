<p>Gratias tibi Deus! It saddens me to read [speculation](http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE50P3YF20090126) that too many will see this as a validation of Bp. Williamson's rants, missing the fact that it is easier to persuade brothers to the truth than it is to persuade enemies. To my brothers and sisters in Abraham: Please receive this act of peace with SSPX not as an endorsement of insulting rhetoric, but as an expression of the Holy Father's desire for all persons, even those persons who provoke us, to be united as one Family in the Lord.</p>
