> Our right to life comes from God. That right does not depend on the whims of politicians or powerful people. That right does not depend on economic or political forces. Our rights come from God. And no man, no institution, and no set of circumstances can justify denying those rights.

&mdash; [A Catholic's Perspective on Immigration and U.S.-Mexico Relations](http://ow.ly/4mJTK). Gómez, José H., Archbishop of Los Angeles. Spero News. 25 Mar. 2011.
