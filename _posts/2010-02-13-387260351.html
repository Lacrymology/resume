<p>> The most important part of any mental prosthetic (as calculators and all forms of finger math are) is that they support good mental models of mathematics rather than replacing them. &mdash; [Andy Harris @ IUPUI](http://www.cs.iupui.edu/~aharris/) from [Thoughts on Chisenbop Multiplication](http://www.cs.iupui.edu/~aharris/chis/mult.html)</p>
<p>Chisanbop (or chisenbop) is a method of using one's fingers for counting and basic maths, similar to an [abacus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus) or [soroban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soroban).<br />
I have been using Chisanbop to [pray the Rosary](http://www.rosaryarmy.com/?page_id=50) when I'm without my Rosary beads ("bead" is from the Old Saxon word "bede," meaning "prayer"). It's a very helpful technique for any repetitive, meditative prayer: the [Jesus Prayer](http://www.jesusprayer.org/), the [Chaplet of Divine Mercy](http://www.praydivinemercy.com/), etc.</p>
<p>### Learning Chisanbop is EASY. Don't let the "math" part scare you:</p>
