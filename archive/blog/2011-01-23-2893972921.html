<p>> Maybe the greatest threat to the Church is not heresy, not dissent, not secularism, not even moral relativism, but this sanitized, feel-good, boutique, therapeutic spirituality that makes no demands, calls for no sacrifice, asks for no conversion, entails no battle against sin, but only soothes and affirms.</p>
<p>&mdash; Archbishop <a href="http://blog.archny.org/">Timothy Dolan</a> of New York (via <a href="http://dixisti.tumblr.com/">dixisti</a>)</p>
