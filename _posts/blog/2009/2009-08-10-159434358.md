Thank you [FactCheck.org](http://FactCheck.org/), for debunking false claims about [euthanasia](http://FactCheck.org/2009/07/false-euthanasia-claims/), [wait lists](http://FactCheck.org/2009/08/dying-on-a-wait-list/), and [the costs](http://FactCheck.org/2009/07/obamas-health-care-news-conference/) of the House's proposed health care bill. In my industry, a crass acronym is often shared with people who refuse to ["read the manual"](http://edlabor.house.gov/documents/111/pdf/publications/AAHCA-BillText-071409.pdf).
