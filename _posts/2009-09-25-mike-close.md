Michael is a rare talent. He is easily the most talented and versatile engineer I've had the pleasure of working with. A lot of programmers like to consider themselves &quot;elite,&quot; but Michael is the only developer I've met who doesn't consider himself so, though his peers unanimously do. Combine that with his rare humility, and what you have is a priceless mentor and leader for the junior members of your team. He is the kind of person who, when given a challenging goal, will deliver something even better than was hoped for. He is also unquestionably trust-worthy, and has a strong moral character.
