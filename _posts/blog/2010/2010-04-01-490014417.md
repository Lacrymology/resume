> Gephi is a tool for exploring and understanding data. Like "Photoshop for data," Gephi allows one to interact with data visualizations, manipulating their structures, shapes and colors to reveal hidden properties. The goal is to help data analysts make hypotheses, intuitively discover patterns, and isolate structural singularities or faults. As an [Exploratory Data Analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis) tool, Gephi complements traditional statistics with [Visual Analytics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Analytics) to [reveal relationships and amplify reasoning](http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/pubs/books/readings-info-vis.shtml).
