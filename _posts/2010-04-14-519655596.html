<p>> And if I have the gift of prophecy and comprehend all mysteries and all knowledge; if I have all faith so as to move mountains but do not have <big><strong>love</strong></big>, I am nothing.</p>
<p>&mdash; [1 Corinthians 13:2](http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/1corinthians/1corinthians13.htm#v2) (NAB)</p>
