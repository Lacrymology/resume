<p>If you learn nothing else in Perl, for the love of sanity, learn this one line.</p>
<p>Replace all occurrences of "oldstring" with "newstring" in all files (no recursion):</p>
<p>    perl -pi -e 's/oldstring/newstring/g' *</p>
<p>Replace all occurrences of "oldstring" with "newstring" in all HTML files recursively:</p>
<p>    perl -pi -e 's/oldstring/newstring/g' `find ./ -name *.html`</p>
<p>Replace all occurrences of "oldstring" with "newstring" in all files recursively:</p>
<p>    perl -pi -e 's/oldstring/newstring/g' `grep -irl oldstring *`</p>
<p>Replace all occurrences of "oldstring" with "newstring" in all files recursively, excluding .svn directories:</p>
<p>    perl -pi -e 's/oldstring/newstring/g' `grep -irl oldstring * | grep -v .svn'</p>
