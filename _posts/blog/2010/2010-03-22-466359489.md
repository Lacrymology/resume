> With the help of police, Muslim extremists last Friday set him on fire for refusing to convert to Islam and raped his wife. The couple's three children, ranging in age from 7 and 12, were forced to watch their parents being brutalised.
O Most Sacred Heart of Jesus, please forgive the deceived, wicked souls who carried out this outrageous offense! Please accept this family's suffering as act of martyrdom for the Faith. Please console the victims and their children, and draw them close to You. O Good Jesus, please use this horrific trial to shine a light on the despotic evil of Mohammedanism and its rotten fruits.
> When they had reached the palace, the king said to them: “Are you then those impious persons who despise the true faith, those foolish persons who blaspheme the prophet sent from God?” “O king,” they answered, “we have no contempt for the true faith; on the contrary, we are ready to suffer and die in its defence; but we detest your faith, and the wicked man who was its author.”
