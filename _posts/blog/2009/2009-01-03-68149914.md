My $0.02: Here is an anecdotal argument for [teaching statistics and computer science](http://www.zedshaw.com/rants/programmer_stats.html) to technologists. Jimmy Wales is not the only "intrapeneur" spinning yarns to support incomplete or inaccurate statistics. Read the [original post](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia) or recent [commentary and emphasis](http://www.alleyinsider.com/2009/1/who-the-hell-writes-wikipedia-anyway) via alleyinsider.
