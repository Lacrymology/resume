<p>Link: <a href="http://goo.gl/D2ChL">A nude awakening - TSA and privacy</a></p>
<p>> Security for the sake of security is pointless &mdash; I can assure you that the risk of terrorism would be neutralized if airline passengers were required to board planes naked but such a requirement would be so intrusive and humiliating that security would have lost its meaningfulness. There’s no purpose in security if it debases the very life it intends to protect, yet the forced choice one has to make between privacy and travel does just that. If you want to travel, you have a “choice” between low-tech fondling or high-tech pornography; the choice, therefore, to relegate your fundamental rights in exchange for a plane ticket. Not only does this paradigm presume that one’s right to privacy is variable &mdash; contingent on the government’s discretion and only respected in places that the government doesn’t care to look &mdash; but it also ignores that the fundamental right to travel has consistently been upheld by the Supreme Court.</p>
