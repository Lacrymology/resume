A typical process for public-facing production servers. Tested in i386 and x86_64 environments.
Basic security protocol suggests no compilers or headers are available on public-facing servers*. Install missing compilers, headers:
    yum install gcc make libxml2-devel
Install the libxml-ruby gem:
    gem install libxml-ruby --no-rdoc --no-ri
Remove compilers, headers and their dependencies:
    yum erase gcc binutils cpp glibc-devel glibc-headers kernel-headers libgomp libxml2-devel pkgconfig zlib-devel make
\* Many years working in e-commerce, fending off various attacks and threats, has nurtured a healthy sense of caution. Do *not* leave unused compilers and headers installed on public-facing machines.
