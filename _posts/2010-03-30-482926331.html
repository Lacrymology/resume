<p>Saint Jonas and Saint Barachisius, brothers and monks, went to Hubaham, Persia, to minister to Chistians imprisoned for their faith during the reign of King Sapor II. On 24 December 327, they were arrested, beaten, tortured, and martyred for this service, and for refusing to worship the sun, moon, fire and water. Jonas died . . .<br />
> by being beaten with clubs, a stake pushed into his abdomen, and left in a freezing pond; when he survived the night, his fingers and toes were cut off, and he was crushed to death in a wine press. His corpse was cut in two, thrown in a dry cistern, and guarded to keep other Christians from recovering relics.</p>

<p>Barachisius was martyred . . .</p>
<p>> by having hot brimstone and pitch poured down his throat.</p>
