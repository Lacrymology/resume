> Groups, trade associations and publications describing themselves as "Catholic" or "pro-life" that endorse the Senate version – whatever their intentions - are doing a serious disservice to the nation and to the Church, undermining the witness of the Catholic community; and ensuring the failure of genuine, ethical health-care reform.
