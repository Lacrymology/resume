<p><img src="/assets/j2.jpg" alt="The Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary" style="float: right; padding-left: 1em;" /> When the archangel Gabriel announced to the Blessed Virgin Mary that she was to be the mother of the Savior, he also told Mary that her cousin Elizabeth was going to have a baby. Elizabeth was an older woman. Mary knew that she would appreciate some help. So she started out at once on the journey to Elizabeth’s house. Mary’s trip was long and dangerous. Riding on a donkey, it was uncomfortable too. But that didn’t stop her. Mary reached her cousin’s house and greeted Elizabeth. At that moment, God revealed to Elizabeth that Mary had become his mother. Elizabeth asked joyfully, ”How have I deserved that the mother of my Lord should come to me?” Mary remained humble. She quickly gave all the credit to God. She exclaimed: “My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, for he has regarded the lowliness of his handmaid, and holy is his name.” What graces the Blessed Mother brought to the home of her cousin! St. John the Baptist, while still hidden in his mother’s womb, was cleansed of original sin. Zachary, Elizabeth’s husband who had become mute for doubting the angel of God, was able to speak again. And Elizabeth was filled with the gifts of the Holy Spirit. Mary stayed three months at her cousin’s home. With great kindness and love, she helped Elizabeth. It was a wonderful time for them both.<br />
