<p>I am Michael, yes a sinner and indeed untaught, the least of all the faithful and most contemptible to many. I am certain in my heart that "all that I am," I have received from God. So I live in the world, a stranger and exile for the love of God. I am driven by the zeal of God, which Christ's truth has aroused in me. I speak out too for love of my neighbors. I am imperfect in many things, nevertheless I want my brethren and kinsfolk to know my nature so that they may be able to perceive my soul's desire. If I have any worth, it is to live my life for God so as to love these peoples; even though some of them despise me. I Cor. 15:10.</p>
