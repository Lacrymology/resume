If you learn nothing else in Perl, for the love of sanity, learn this one line.
Replace all occurrences of "oldstring" with "newstring" in all files (no recursion):
    perl -pi -e 's/oldstring/newstring/g' *
Replace all occurrences of "oldstring" with "newstring" in all HTML files recursively:
    perl -pi -e 's/oldstring/newstring/g' `find ./ -name *.html`
Replace all occurrences of "oldstring" with "newstring" in all files recursively:
    perl -pi -e 's/oldstring/newstring/g' `grep -irl oldstring *`
Replace all occurrences of "oldstring" with "newstring" in all files recursively, excluding .svn directories:
    perl -pi -e 's/oldstring/newstring/g' `grep -irl oldstring * | grep -v .svn'
