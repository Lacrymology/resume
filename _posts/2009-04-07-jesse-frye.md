I miss having Michael on my projects! He was the crazy professor who could help anyone improve their projects whether it be through project management, training, or out of the box thinking. You can tell Michael received his vast spectrum of expertise in, seemingly, every field by his focused curiosity and his compulsiveness that won't allow him to turn in sub-par work. I have also seen Michael take high school educated students who know a couple html nodes and turn them into self-supportive developers in as little as 2 years!

Michael is literally a genius in every area of technology I have ever asked him a question about. Having him as a mentor, he patiently took me from a very limited amount of knowledge to a broad amount of experience. Michael has been the brains behind a multitude of organizations; not only developing the technology behind the business, but actually inventing the business models to create new revenue or expand existing models.
