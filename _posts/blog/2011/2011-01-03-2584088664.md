Please include Sr. Carol Keehan and the CHA in your prayers, that they may repent and embrace Catholic ethical health care guidelines. Their public rejection of Catholic teaching and defiance toward the USCCB and the Pope &mdash; in this case and in regard to health care reform &mdash; scandalizes the laity, puts Sr. Keehan at risk of automatic excommunication and the CHA at risk of losing its Catholic status. Sr. Keehan was the source of many of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi's distorted misunderstanding of Catholic ethics.
