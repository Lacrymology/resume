In World War I, he ran a hospital for the wounded; he personally treated almost 3,000 soldiers. He healed (sometimes miraculously), taught at numerous universities and hospitals, and supported the poor and outcast; he could sometimes diagnose a patient’s illness and prescribe for it without having seen the patient. He knew when and how to use a patient’s faith and the sacraments to effect a cure. He is the first modern physician to be canonized.
Patron of physicians, pray for us.
