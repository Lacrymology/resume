> The truth is that sex abuse (particularly of children) is not just a Catholic problem &mdash; it’s a _human problem_. This is not something unique to the Catholic Church. It is happening in every religion. Every organization. Every school system. In fact, many [studies indicate](http://www.catholicleague.org/research/abuse_in_social_context.htm) that pedophilia (and other sex abuse) happens even more often in other religions and denominations than in the Catholic Church. And it happens more still within the public school system. And that includes the cover-ups as well. In other words, if you think it’s a problem in the Catholic Church, then just remember it is even worse in most every other denomination, organization and within the school system.</p>
