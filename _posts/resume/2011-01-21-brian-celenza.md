Put simply, Michael is the most talented developer I have ever had the pleasure of working with. His knowledge is as deep as it is wide. His mentorship is greatly cherished among those who have worked for and with him. Michael is a true expert in all things TDD/BDD, Agile, Scrum, and MVC. This expertise is only rivaled by that of his programming language knowledge: Ruby, PHP, Flex, ActionScript, JavaScript, and many more. Michael is a true thought leader and systems architect in a world where such a thing has become exceedingly rare. I look forward to his continued mentorship and friendship for years to come.
