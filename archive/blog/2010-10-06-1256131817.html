<p>Sharding? Seriously? If that's MongoDB's solution to "scaling," we can go ahead and count them out of the newfangled "NoSQL" DB race. In fact, word to all you NoSQL geeks: I can get sick performance gains out of MySQL by simply replacing my DB server's drives with SSDs. Doing so will make MySQL nearly as fast as NoSQL, without the ridiculous replication mess, AND I get to keep my referential integrity. Think about it...</p>
