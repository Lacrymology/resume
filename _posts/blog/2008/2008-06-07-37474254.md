1. Verify X11 is working on Leopard by opening X11 (Applications > Utilities > X11) and verifying you see an xterm. If not, download [XQuartz](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/X112.1.4) community-sponsored X11 update (until Apple produces its own).
2. Download and run [Darwine](http://www.kronenberg.org/darwine/).
