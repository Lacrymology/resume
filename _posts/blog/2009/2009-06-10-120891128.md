I have recently become a fan of using Christian Neukirchen's [Bacon](http://github.com/chneukirchen/bacon) test framework for my Rails projects. A lightweight tool, Bacon does not provide colorized terminal output ala [RedGreen](http://on-ruby.blogspot.com/2006/05/red-and-green-for-ruby.html). So I created a lightweight companion to colorize Bacon output called GreenEggs.

Enjoy!
