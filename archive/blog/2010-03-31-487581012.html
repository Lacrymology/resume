<p>> Oh God, Who didst impart to Blessed Bonaventure, the Confessor, the grace of recalling sinners to repentance, grant we beseach Thee, through his merits and intercession, that we may also weep over our sins, so that, renewed in heart and will, we may serve Thee faithfully until death. Through Jesus Christ, Our Lord. Amen.</p>
<p>&mdash; “[Blessed Bonaventure Tornielli](http://saints.sqpn.com/saintb2v.htm)”. Saints.SQPN.com.</p>
