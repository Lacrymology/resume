> A movement that bets the farm on lionizing the use of lies for a good end is a movement that will soon experience another public relations catastrophe and have nobody but itself to blame since we were warned by the Church that lying is intrinsically immoral.

&mdash; Shea, Mark. National Catholic Register. 18 Feb. 2011.
