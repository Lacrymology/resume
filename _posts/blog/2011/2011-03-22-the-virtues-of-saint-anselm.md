The last sentence, in particular, reminds me of the complaints levied against Pope St. John Paul II:

> He was often even blamed and suffered in his reputation on account of his undiscerning &hellip; cultivation of the virtues which were more fitting for a monk of his cloister than for the primate of so great a nation. His high humility, his boundless patience &hellip; were all in this respect noted censured and condemned. And **above all he was blamed for his lack of judgment in the mildness of his proceedings**, for &mdash; as most people saw it &mdash; there were many on whom he ought to have inflicted ecclesiastical discipline, who took advantage of his mildness to remain in their wickedness as if by his consent.

&mdash; Vita Anselmi. Eadmer. c. 1124. via [St. Anselm on Anger](http://gbsadler.blogspot.com/2011/02/saint-anselm-on-anger-part-2.html) by Gregory Sadler.
