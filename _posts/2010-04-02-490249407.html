<p>St. Hugh was born in 1052 in France. He grew up to be tall and handsome, gentle and courteous. Although he always wanted to live for God as a monk, he was given important positions instead. He was ordained a priest and then a bishop. As bishop, Hugh began at once to correct unjust customs of some people in his diocese. He made wise plans, but that was not all he did. To draw God’s mercy upon his people, Bishop Hugh prayed with his whole heart and offered sacrifices. In a short time, many of the people became virtuous and prayerful. Only some of the nobility continued to oppose him. Bishop Hugh still thought about the life of a monk. It was what he truly wanted. He resigned as bishop of Grenoble and entered a monastery. At last, he was at peace. Yet it was not God’s will for Hugh to be a monk. After a year, the pope sent him back to Grenoble again. Hugh obeyed. He knew it was more important to please God than to please himself. For forty years, Bishop Hugh was sick nearly all the time. He had severe headaches and stomach problems. But he kept on working. He loved his people and there was so much to do for them. Bishop Hugh died on April 1, 1132, two months before his eightieth birthday. He had been a generous and holy bishop for fifty-two years. In 1134, just two years after his death, Hugh was proclaimed a saint by Pope Innocent II.<br />
