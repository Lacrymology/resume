<p>A recent [Obama-Palin tit-for-tat](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/09/08/obama_to_palin_dont_mock_the_c.html) inspired me to comment:<br />
Our ratification of the Third Geneva Convention comes with reservations publicly declared upon signing:</p>
<p>"The United States reserve the right to impose the death penalty in accordance with the provisions of Article 68, paragraph 2, without regard to whether the offences referred to therein are punishable by death under the law of the occupied territory at the time the occupation begins."</p>
<p>http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/NORM/D6B53F5B5D14F35AC1256402003F9920?OpenDocument</p>
<p>In other words: We reserve the right to execute as we see fit, irrespective of the laws of the occupied territory (and not necessarily according to our own laws).</p>
