<p>By what name shall I address thee, O Martin!<br />
Shall I call thee the glorious leader of the Orthodox Faith for all?<br />
Or the sacred chief of divine dogmas speaking nought but truth?<br />
Or the most true reprover of error? ...<br />
We know that thou wast the foundation of bishops, pillar of the Orthodox Faith, teacher of religion. ...<br />
Thou didst adorn the Divine See of Peter, and since then thou on his divine Rock hast preserved the Church immovable, so now with him [Peter] art thou glorified.</p>
<p>What shall we call you now, Martin?<br />
Celebrated instructor in orthodox teachings;<br />
sure leader of the choir of priests in the precepts of God,<br />
most faithful denouncer of falsehood,<br />
most valiant companion of the word,<br />
most holy performer of the sacred mysteries,<br />
most honored wonder-worker!<br />
**Pray that our souls may be saved!**</p>
<p>What shall we call you now, Martin?<br />
River full of spiritual waters,<br />
ever watering souls for spiritual fertility,<br />
lamp shining with the light of piety,<br />
mountain pouring forth divine joy,<br />
revealer of the words of God,<br />
denouncer of every heresy!<br />
**Pray that our souls may be saved!**</p>
<p>What shall we call you now, Martin?<br />
All-revered celebrant of the true tabernacle,<br />
godly mediator between God and creation,<br />
cup pouring forth divine drink,<br />
beacon possessing the word of life,<br />
proceeding from the West and made manifest in the East!<br />
**Pray that our souls may be saved!**</p>
<p>&mdash; from Kalendarium Manuale Utriusque Ecclesiae Orientalis et Occidentalis, by Nicolaus Nilles, S.J., Innsbruck, 1897.</p>
