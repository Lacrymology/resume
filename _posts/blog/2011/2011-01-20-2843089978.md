> Regardless of your opinion of the Android platform for mobile devices, there's no arguing the point Tim Cook, acting CEO of Apple, made during the company's earning's call earlier this week: "The next generation of Android tablets, which is what you discussed primarily at CES &mdash; there's nothing shipping yet&hellip; Generally they lack performance specs, they lack prices, they lack timing, and so today they're vapor."
> Yes, we saw an endless supply of Android tablets from manufacturers at CES, but only one of them was running Honeycomb, Google's tablet-focused, latest update to Android. I use the word "running" liberally when I shouldn't: the Motorola Xoom merely played a video demo. The interface and touch screen weren't ready. Every other tablet, save for the RIM BlackBerry PlayBook (which actually was completely functional, running the BlackBerry Tablet OS, during hands-ons with the press), was running either Android 2.1 or 2.2, neither of which is designed to work on tablet screens.
