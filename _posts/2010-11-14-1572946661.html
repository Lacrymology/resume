<p>> O man, cling to God, by whom you were made a man; cling to him, rely on him call upon him, let him be your strength. Say to him, “In you, Lord, is my strength”. And in response to the threats of men you will sing; and the Lord himself tells you what you should sing at the end of it all: “In God will I hope, I will not fear what man may do to me.” (Psalm 56:11)</p>
<p>&mdash; St. Augustine, <a href="http://mystical.agustinongpinoy.net/archives/244">Sermon 97</a></p>
