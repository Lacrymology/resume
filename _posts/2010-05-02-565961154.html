He devoted his life to proving that Jesus is truly God. This was important because some people called Arians were denying this truth. Even before he became a priest, Athanasius had read many books on Scripture and theology. That is why he could explain the faith so easily. This saint became the archbishop of Alexandria before he was thirty years old. For forty-six years, he was a brave shepherd of his flock. Four Roman emperors could not make him stop writing his clear and beautiful explanations of our holy faith. His enemies persecuted him in every way. Archbishop Athanasius was sent out of his own diocese five times. His first exile lasted two years. He was sent to the city of Trier in Germany in 336. A kindly bishop, St. Maximinius, welcomed him warmly. Other exiles lasted longer. Athanasius was even hunted by people who wanted to kill him. During one tense exile, monks kept him hidden from his enemies in the desert for six years. Once the emperor’s soldiers were chasing Athanasius down the Nile River. ”They’re catching up to us!” cried the saint’s friends. Athanasius was not worried. ”Turn the boat around,” he said calmly, ”and row toward them.” The emperor’s soldiers shouted, “Have you seen Athanasius?” “You’re not far from him!” Athanasius’s friends shouted back. The enemy boat sped by them faster than ever, and the saint was safe. The people of Alexandria loved their archbishop. He was a real father to them. As the years passed, they appreciated more and more how much he suffered for Jesus and the Church. It was the people who stepped in and saw to it that Athanasius had some well-deserved peace. He spent the last seven years of his life safe with them. His enemies searched for him but could never find him. During that time, Athanasius wrote The Life of St. Anthony the Hermit. Anthony had been his personal friend when Athanasius was young. (St. Anthony’s feast day is celebrated on January 17.) St. Athanasius died quietly on May 2, 373. He remains one of the greatest, bravest saints of all time.<br />
