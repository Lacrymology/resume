> Almighty God, who didst call thy servant Cuthbert from keeping sheep to follow thy Son and to be a shepherd of thy people, mercifully grant that we, following his example and caring for those who a lost, may bring them home to thy fold, through thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
&mdash; St. Cuthbert Day Prayer inscribed in wall at the Shrine of St. Cuthbert, Durham Cathedral, UK.
