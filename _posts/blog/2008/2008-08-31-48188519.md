Shannan told me palm oil manufacturing in Indonesia and Malaysia is [threatening orangutans](http://www.google.com/search?q=palm+oil+orangutans). She also said that Earth Balance (butter substitute for vegans and low-cholesterol diets) is mostly palm oil.
Our friend Jesse is vegan for love of animals, so we did a little digging into Earth Balance and read their claim that palm oil is better than soy oil for "green" reasons. It sounded like hooey to me: I think the *real* reason they don't want to use hydrogenated soy oil is because Whole Foods won't carry hydrogenated oils. Then I stumbled upon this perspective (which quotes the aforementioned Earth Balance answer):

A more little digging revealed that the orangutan isn't the only species threatened. The tapir, Sumatran tiger, Asian elephant, Sumatran rhino, acres of rain forest and indigenous people are all being displaced by Malaysian and Indonesian palm oil plantations:

Hmm. Clicked some links in the comments and "voila!" (in order):
http://www.daabon.com/usa/palm_oil.htm
http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/wholebody/ingredients/palmoil.html
http://www.rspo.org/
We can buy sustainably sourced palm oil products instead! Whole Foods' private label and "Spectrum" brand (sold @ Whole Foods) both source from sustainable (for flora AND fauna) farms.
Why Earth Balance hasn't teamed up with the RPSO or Daabon is beyond me. Until they do, we'll be buying another product.
