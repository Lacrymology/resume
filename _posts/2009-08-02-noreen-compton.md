I hired Michael during his tenure at Disinovate to design and program my web sites, provide technical support for them, and help me maintain and upgrade my business equipment. And he always delivered - in spades.

Michael is one of those people who was taking apart computers when he was just a kid, and he never stopped being fascinated by how things work and how to find better solutions to problems. But he is not an "Iâ€™m-too-busy-to-dumb-it-down-for-you" kind of guy. He has the unique ability and patience to explain complex technical issues and terms to those of us who are more "technically challenged.""

Michael has a real passion for his work and a professional work ethic. He is a talented programmer and engineer, as well as a true leader and visionary. He writes code that not just solves problems, but always has business needs at the forefront.

His knowledge of online and software solutions is impressive. He never failed to find innovative answers to any problems I had. Michael has a brilliant and creative mind, making him a fascinating and fantastic person to have on your team. And he is just a really nice person to boot.

Working with Michael was truly a highlight of my career. I highly recommend Michael for projects. Just give him some specs and watch him go!
