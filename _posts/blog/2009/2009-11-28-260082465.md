> O transitory life, how many hast thou deceived, seduced, and blinded! If I consider the rapidity of thy flight, thou seemest a nothing: thy existence is little more than a shadow. They who set their hearts on thee, know thee not; they only understand thee, who despise thy enjoyments. When thou shewest thyself, thou art again withdrawn as if thou wert no more than a phantom. What art thou but a swift course on a road, passing as a bird on the wing, uncertain as a cloud, frail as a vapour, vanishing as a shadow.
&mdash; St. Columban ([The Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs, and Other Principal Saints](http://books.google.com/books?id=_HgTAAAAQAAJ&pg=PR1#v=onepage&q=&f=false) by Rev. Alban Butler)
