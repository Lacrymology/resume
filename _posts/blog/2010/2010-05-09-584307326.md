<img src="/assets/size1.jpg" alt="Blessed Nicholas Albergati" style="float: right; padding-left: 1em;" /> Nicholas was born in Bologna, Italy. His family could afford to send him to the university where he began to study law. But after a few years, he decided not to become a lawyer. At the age of twenty, Nicholas joined the Carthusian Order. In 1417, he was chosen to be bishop of his native diocese. He had not counted on that at all. He could not even believe it could be Godâ€™s will. But his superiors assured him it was. People liked Bishop Nicholas. He lived in a small, plain house. He was like them. He began to visit the people of his diocese. He went to the poorest families first. He talked with them and helped them with their needs. He blessed their homes. The people were very grateful. Bishop Nicholas became a cardinal in 1426. He was known to be wise and holy. Two popes, Martin V and Eugene IV, consulted him about important Church matters. Nicholas also encouraged learning. In fact, he wrote several books himself. Bishop Nicholas died in 1443, while on a visit to Siena, Italy. Pope Eugene IV had his body brought back to Bologna. The pope himself participated in the funeral Mass and burial.
