They were widely honored and prayed to by the early Christians. The feast of these two martyrs was included in the Roman calendar of saints by Pope Vigilius in 555. Marcellinus was a priest. Peter assisted him in his ministry. Both were very brave in the practice of their Christian faith. They served the Christian com- munity with great self-sacrifice. During the persecution of Diocletian, many Christians were killed. Marcellinus and Peter were martyred in 304. As they awaited execution in prison, they continued to witness to their faith in Jesus. Many people, including their jailer and his family, were impressed by their strong faith and became Christians too. When the time came for their execution, Marcellinus and Peter were brought to a hidden spot in a forest called Silva Nigra. This was done to keep the Christians from finding them. Marcellinus and Peter were put to work clearing the briars away to prepare the place where they would be buried. Then they were beheaded. Some time later, their executioner was sorry for the terrible thing he had done. He led the Christians to the graves. Then Marcellinus and Peter were buried in the catacomb of St. Tiberius. Pope Gregory IV sent their relics to Frankfurt, Germany, in 827. He believed that the relics of these two saints would bring blessings to the Church in that nation.<br />
