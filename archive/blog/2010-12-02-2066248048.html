<p>Shannan has been diagnosed with gestational diabetes, and she's sad about having to give up, among other things, hot cocoa. Chocoholic husband to the rescue! Makes 1 *tasty* cup:</p>
<p>* 1 heaping teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder<br />
* 1/4 teaspoon (leveled) Stevia<br />
* A dash of salt<br />
* A dash of cinnamon<br />
* A dash of cayenne<br />
* 2 teaspoons skim milk</p>
<p>Combine in a mug, stirring until smooth. Then fill the mug with milk, stirring. Microwave on high for 45 seconds, stir, then another 45 seconds in the microwave. Enjoy!</p>
<p>Note: Depending on the cocoa and milk used, this drink contains approximately 9g protein, 12g carbohydrates, 2g fiber, 11g sugar, 100 calories and <1g fat.</p>
