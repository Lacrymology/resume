> Today we see in a truly terrifying way that the greatest persecution of the Church does not come from outside enemies but is born of sin within the Church. The church thus has a deep need to re-learn penance, to accept purification, to learn on one hand forgiveness but also the necessity of justice. Forgiveness does not exclude justice.
&mdash; Pope Benedict XVI, [11 May 2010](http://ht.ly/1JPCR). via @[iamKevinClay](http://twitter.com/iamKevinClay).
