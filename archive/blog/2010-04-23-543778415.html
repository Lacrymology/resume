<p>Though I'm a relatively insignificant donor to [Catholic Relief Services](http://crs.org/), I love hearing about the incredible work they perform overseas, and I encourage you to learn more about them. Whether it is responding to the recent earthquake in Haiti or quietly addressing the grinding poverty and hunger that affect so many of the world's poor, they do so efficiently and effectively.<br />
* Meet Nelson, a teenager in Honduras who found a way [off the street and into his own business](http://donate.crs.org/site/R?i=Squ_cZIxDKWie0u6-PYRVA..) through a door opened by CRS.<br />
* In drought-prone, dusty Ethiopia, see [Beletachi show off her green field](http://donate.crs.org/site/R?i=RYEcZGnrFiPkRXOoJ_5f1A..) of crops made possible by CRS seed fairs.<br />
* Witness a [miracle in Sudan](http://donate.crs.org/site/R?i=Ld0IRuwMTthPukk7wnI5pw..), where more than 60 leaders from Sudan's various Christian churches joined Muslim clerics and other government and church officials to unify their vision for promoting peace in their war-torn country.<br />
* Learn how a small gift of livestock has completely [transformed the lives of Sipho Ncube and her family](http://donate.crs.org/site/R?i=_1G5xDvtBnk4QceESmN-xA..) in Zimbabwe, allowing them to be self-sufficient and no longer require food aid.</p>
<p>You may not know that [CRS](http://crs.org/) is often referred to as the "best-kept secret in the American Catholic Church." I hope that you will take a minute to learn more about the extraordinary work they do on our behalf, for the poorest of our brothers and sisters around the world. Please visit their website or sign up for e-mail alerts.  Thank you!</p>
<p>Together as one human family, we can [transform the world](http://crs.org/)!</p>
