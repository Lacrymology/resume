Philip was one of the first apostles chosen. He was born at Bethsaida, in Galilee. When Jesus met him, he said, “Follow me.” Philip was so happy to be with Jesus that he wanted to share his happiness with his friend, Nathaniel. ”We have found the one Moses and the prophets wrote about,” Philip explained. ”He is Jesus of Nazareth.” Nathaniel wasn’t at all excited. Nazareth was just a little village. It wasn’t big and important like Jerusalem. So Nathaniel said, ”Can any good come out of Nazareth?” But Philip did not become angry at his friend’s answer. He just said, “Come and see.” So Nathaniel went to see Jesus. After he had spoken with him, he, too, became a zealous follower of the Lord. St. James was also one of Jesus’ twelve apostles. He was the son of Alpheus and a cousin of Jesus. After Jesus ascended into heaven, James became the bishop of Jerusalem. People thought so much of him that they called him “James the Just,” which means “James the Holy One.” He is also called “James the Less,” because he was younger than the other apostle named James, who was called “James the Greater.” St. James was very gentle and forgiving. He prayed very much. He kept begging God to forgive the peo- ple who persecuted the followers of Jesus. Even when Jesus’ enemies were putting James to death, he asked God to pardon them. St. James died as a martyr in the year 62.
