Michael Fleet has an incredible bandwidth of knowledge and experience with online solutions, e-commerce, social networks, and consumer/merchant software solutions. His technical skills in Flash, Ruby, Rails, HTML, Javascript are unsurpassed.

Combine that knowledge and experience with a unrelenting passion for excellence and a tenacious work ethic and you get Michael Fleet; an amazing senior developer and team lead that is irreplaceable.

Michael writes software and understands Rich User Experiences (RUX/RIA) like most people walk... he was born to it and doesn't have to think about the mechanics. He simply focuses on requirements, features, and solutions.

As the true visionary at Ustrive he provided inspiration and leadership excellence to the CartFly and Sellit dev teams and product platforms. Working with Michael was a complete pleasure. Personally, I would jump at the chance to work with him again. His creativity and passion is contagious and energizing.
