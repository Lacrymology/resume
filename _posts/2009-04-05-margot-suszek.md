You can't just call Michael an IT guy, or a developer, programmer, or the web guy-- that would lump him in with too many average (or even above average) developers. Michael is truly a genius. If you can imagine it- he can develop it. If you can't imagine it- let him help you bring something wonderful to life. A remarkably talented, deeply knowledgeable and inventive man.  I can’t say enough good things about Michael’s talent, good nature, and work ethic; a true joy to work with. If you are considering hiring- make sure you keep him in the mix, his talent will speak for itself, and you won't be disappointed.
