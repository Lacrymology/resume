<p>> Who can sufficiently eulogize our dear Lea's mode of living? So complete was her conversion to the Lord that, becoming the head of a monastery, she showed herself a true mother to the virgins in it, wore coarse sackcloth instead of soft raiment, passed sleepless nights in prayer, and instructed her companions even more by example than by precept. So great was her humility that she, who had once been the mistress of many, was accounted the servant of all; and certainly, the less she was reckoned an earthly mistress the more she became a servant of Christ. She was careless of her dress, neglected her hair, and ate only the coarsest food. Still, in all that she did, she avoided ostentation that she might not have her [reward](http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/matthew/matthew6.htm#v2) in this world.<br />
&mdash; ><br />
> Now, therefore, in return for her short toil, Lea enjoys everlasting felicity; she is welcomed into the choirs of the angels; she is comforted in Abraham's bosom. And, as once the beggar Lazarus saw the rich man, for all his purple, lying in torment, so does Lea see the consul, not now in his triumphal robe but clothed in mourning, and asking for a drop of water from her little [finger](http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/luke/luke16.htm#v19). How great a change have we here! A few days ago the highest dignitaries of the city walked before him as he ascended the ramparts of the capitol like a general celebrating a triumph; the Roman people leapt up to welcome and applaud him, and at the news of his death the whole city was moved. Now he is desolate and naked, a prisoner in the foulest darkness, and not, as his unhappy wife falsely asserts, set in the royal abode of the milky way. On the other hand Lea, who was always shut up in her one closet, who seemed poor and of little worth, and whose life was [accounted madness](http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/wisdom/wisdom5.htm#v4), now follows Christ and sings, Like as we have heard, so have we seen in the city of our God.<br />
><br />
> And now for the moral of all this, which, with tears and groans, I conjure you to remember. While we run the way of this world, we must not clothe ourselves with two coats, that is, with a twofold faith, or burden ourselves with leathern shoes, that is, with dead works; we must not allow scrips filled with money to weigh us down, or lean upon the [staff](http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/matthew/matthew10.htm#v10) of worldly power. We must not seek to possess both Christ and the world. No; things eternal must take the place of things [transitory](http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/2corinthians/2corinthians4.htm#v18); and since, physically speaking, we daily anticipate death, if we wish for immortality we must realize that we are but mortal.</p>
