<p>Mary, on this day when we honor all mothers, we turn to you. We thank the Lord whom you serve for the great gift of motherhood. Never has it been known that anyone who sought your intercession was left unaided by grace. Dear Mother, thank you for your "Yes" to the invitation of the angel which brought heaven to earth and changed human history. You opened yourself to Godâ€™s word and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.<br />
Dear mother, intercede for all of our mothers. Ask your Divine Son to give them the grace of surrendered love so that they could join with you in giving their own "Fiat." May they find daily strength to say yes to the call to the sacrificial love -- the very heart of the vocation of motherhood. May their love and witness be a source of great inspiration for all of us called to follow your Son.</p>
<p>On this Mothers day, Mother of the Word Incarnate, pray for us who have recourse to you...</p>
<p>In the Name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.</p>
