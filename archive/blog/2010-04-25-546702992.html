<p>![The New Colossus](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l1eo7npiin1qz9pwk.jpg)<br />
> Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,<br />
With conquering limbs astride from land to land;<br />
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand<br />
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame<br />
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name<br />
Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand<br />
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command<br />
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.<br />
"Keep ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she<br />
With silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor,<br />
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,<br />
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.<br />
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,<br />
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"</p>
<p>&mdash; "[The New Colossus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Colossus)." Emma Lazarus. 1883.</p>
