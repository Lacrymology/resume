		&mdash; Holy Cross Church, Warsaw, Poland. Photo by [Matt Edmund](http://linxsan.vox.com/). The inscription reads Sursum Corda ("Lift Up Your Hearts"), to remind Poland and the world that [tyranny was defeated by the faith, hope and heart of the Poles: The Cross](http://www.torenewamerica.com/lift-up-your-hearts).
Saint Stanislaus, Bishop, Martyr, and Patron of Poland, pray for us and Poland!
