<p>> [Brooke Baldwin interviewed the prosecutor](http://www.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/01/19/pennsylvania.abortion.doctor/index.html) on the case, Seth Williams. &hellip; He spoke of the "house of horrors" they found &hellip; where these dead children were kept in bottles of formaldehyde. &hellip; that they found "severed feet" and "body parts" everywhere, including in the same refrigerator where staff kept their lunch. &hellip; that the doctor was paid on a sliding scale depending on the age and size of the child. &hellip; that these abortion "clinics" are not regulated, noting that **barber shops receive more governmental scrutiny**.</p>
