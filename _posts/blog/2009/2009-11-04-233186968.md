Creating a CakePHP 1.2.5 app on a Snow Leopard machine, which comes with PHP 5.3, I encountered the following error when I tried to run the app:
"The requested URL /Users/username/Sites/cakeapp/app/webroot/ was not found on this server."
The solution is to use the RewriteBase directive in ~/Sites/cakeapp/.htaccess:
    <ifmodule mod_rewrite.c>
      RewriteEngine On
      #  NOTE THE TILDE:
      RewriteBase /~username/cakeapp/
      RewriteRule ^$ app/webroot/ [L]
      RewriteRule (.*) app/webroot/$1 [L]
    </ifmodule>
AND in ~/Sites/cakeapp/app/.htaccess:
    <ifmodule mod_rewrite.c>
      RewriteEngine On
      #  NOTE THE TILDE:
      RewriteBase /~username/cakeapp/app/
      RewriteRule ^$ app/webroot/ [L]
      RewriteRule (.*) app/webroot/$1 [L]
    </ifmodule>
AND in ~/Sites/cakeapp/app/webroot/.htaccess:
    <ifmodule mod_rewrite.c>
      RewriteEngine On
      #  NOTE THE TILDE:
      RewriteBase /~username/cakeapp/app/webroot/
      RewriteRule ^$ app/webroot/ [L]
      RewriteRule (.*) app/webroot/$1 [L]
    </ifmodule>
