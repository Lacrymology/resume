> St. Patrick, the patron Saint of Ireland whose legacy we celebrate today, used the three-leaved shamrock to illustrate the idea of the Trinity to the pre-Christian Irish people of the 4th century.  The Trinity is a profound revelation that cannot be fully understood on this side of heaven, yet we can know something of this mystery. Father Barron, following in the footsteps of St. Patrick, offers his reflection on this essential belief of the Catholic Faith.
