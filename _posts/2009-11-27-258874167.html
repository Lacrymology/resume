<p>&laquo;Their correspondence show a claque of scientists massaging data to make it fit their theories, squelching scientists who disagreed, punishing academic journals that didn't toe the apocalyptic line, and hiding their work from public view. &quot;It's no use pretending that this isn't a major blow,&quot; glumly wrote George Monbiat, a U.K. writer who has been among the fiercest warming alarmists.
