> I think fashion is repulsive. The whole idea that someone else can make clothing that is supposed to be in style and make other people look good is ridiculous. It sickens me to think that there is an industry that plays to the low self-esteem of the general public. I would like the fashion industry to collapse. I think it plays to the most superficial, most insecure parts of human nature. I hope GQ as a magazine fails. I hope that all of these people who make a living by looking pretty are eventually made destitute or forced to do something of substance. At least pornography has a function.
&mdash; Steve Albini comparing fashion to pornography during an interview with [GQ](http://www.gq.com/blogs/the-q/2010/09/steve-albini.html). While I don't agree that pornography's function justifies its existence, I do see the fashion and pornography industries becoming less dissimilar every day. via [Pitchfork](http://pitchfork.com/news/40293-steve-albini-goes-off-on-sonic-youth/).
