				Put simply, Michael is the most talented developer I have ever had the pleasure of working with. His knowledge is as deep as it is wide. His mentorship is greatly cherished among those who have worked for and with him. Michael is a true expert in all things TDD/BDD, Agile, Scrum, and MVC. This expertise is only rivaled by that of his programming language knowledge: Ruby, PHP, Flex, ActionScript, JavaScript, and many more. Michael is a true thought leader and systems architect in a world where such a thing has become exceedingly rare. I look forward to his continued mentorship and friendship for years to come.

				Michael is one of those rare combinations of brilliant engineer and business visionary.  He stays on top of both the technical and business sides of the Internet industry.  Michael excels at software engineering, but can just as easily guide product direction, and can help non-technical business developers leverage the most of their technology assets and potential.

I have worked with Michael for over half a decade and have always been impressed and inspired.  I would work with him again in a heartbeat!

				Michael is a rare talent.  He is easily the most talented and versatile engineers I've had the pleasure of working with.  A lot of programmers like to consider themselves &quot;elite,&quot; but Michael is the only developer I've met who doesn't consider himself so, though his peers unanimously do.  Combine that with his rare humility, and what you have is a priceless mentor and leader for the junior members of your team.  He is the kind of person who, when given a challenging goal, will deliver something even better than was hoped for.  He is also unquestionably trust-worthy, and has a strong moral character.

				Michael Fleet has an incredible bandwidth of knowledge and experience with online solutions, e-commerce, social networks, and consumer/merchant software solutions. His technical skills in Flash, Ruby, Rails, HTML, Javascript are unsurpassed.

Combine that knowledge and experience with a unrelenting passion for excellence and a tenacious work ethic and you get Michael Fleet; an amazing senior developer and team lead that is irreplaceable.

Michael writes software and understands Rich User Experiences (RUX/RIA) like most people walk... he was born to it and doesn't have to think about the mechanics. He simply focuses on requirements, features, and solutions.

As the true visionary at Ustrive he provided inspiration and leadership excellence to the CartFly and Sellit dev teams and product platforms. Working with Michael was a complete pleasure. Personally, I would jump at the chance to work with him again. His creativity and passion is contagious and energizing.

				Michael isn't just a programmer. He is truly a visionary and fun to work with. He is the brains behind all of the programming and engineering for POPLOGIX. There is absolutely nothing I come up with that he can't make better.

				I miss having Michael on my projects! He was the crazy professor who could help anyone improve their projects whether it be through project management, training, or out of the box thinking. You can tell Michael received his vast spectrum of expertise in, seemingly, every field by his focused curiosity and his compulsiveness that won't allow him to turn in sub-par work. I have also seen Michael take high school educated students who know a couple html nodes and turn them into self-supportive developers in as little as 2 years!

				You can't just call Michael an IT guy, or a developer, programmer, or the web guy-- that would lump him in with too many average (or even above average) developers. Michael is truly a genius. If you can imagine it- he can develop it. If you can't imagine it- let him help you bring something wonderful to life. A remarkably talented, deeply knowledgeable and inventive man.  I can’t say enough good things about Michael’s talent, good nature, and work ethic; a true joy to work with. If you are considering hiring- make sure you keep him in the mix, his talent will speak for itself, and you won't be dissapointed.

				I have had the immense honor of working with Michael on various projects for assorted companies for going on 8 years.

Frankly in my 23 years of being in this field, I have never met a more talented, resourceful, or skilled developer.

Michael easily and skillfully does in 1 hour, what would take 90% of the programmers in the field today 6 to 8 hours.

If Michael says he can do your project, he can, and will produce results the likes you have never dreamed of.

You simply can not hire a more talented, skilled, or knowledgeable person.

				Michael is that guy you bring in to figure out how to do the impossible. That's what he does; he does the impossible and he does it really well. I have run in to very few people in this world with his amazing capability to find a creative technological solution to the seemingly unsolvable. Combine that with a sharp brain that's always focused on the practical and (most importantly) the revenue, and you've got an invaluable addition to your team.

				Michael is literally a genius in every area of technology I have ever asked him a question about. Having him as a mentor, he patiently took me from a very limited amount of knowledge to a broad amount of experience. Michael has been the brains behind a multitude of organizations; not only developing the technology behind the business, but actually inventing the business models to create new revenue or expand existing models.

				I met Michael in January 2007 when Ustrive2 was getting off the ground.  In my capacity as a consultant responsible for crafting business plans and raising seed capital, I had the good fortune of working closely with Michael as the ideas for distributive e-commerce were taking shape.  My experiences with programmers up till then had been less than satisfying.  Michael was a breath of fresh air.  He is personable, well-grounded, unique, responsible and a man of his word.  He has a keen business mind which I believe is one reason why his execution is so effective and elegant. I enjoyed working with Micheal and would love to so again.

				Mike is one of the most brilliant developers I've ever met.  What makes him great is not just that he is passionate about the code, but also so incredibly mindful of the business goals and intent of the project.  He ALWAYS came up with something better than what was presented as original concept.

His love for music and coffee made for a great personable experience as well as strong punctual results for our client. I would definitely recommend Michael for any project that you may have.
