<p>### The Lorica of Saint Patrick<br />
<small>Also known as "Saint Patrick's Breastplate" or "The Deer's Cry".</small></p>
<p><img src="/assets/St._Patrick.jpg" alt="Saint Patrick" align="right" style="margin: 8px;" /></p>
<p>I arise today<br />
Through a mighty strength,<br />
The invocation of the Trinity,<br />
Through belief in the threeness,<br />
Through confession of the oneness<br />
Of the Creator of Creation.</p>
<p>I arise today<br />
Through the strength of<br />
Christ’s birth with His baptism,<br />
Through the strength of<br />
His crucifixion with His burial,<br />
Through the strength of<br />
His resurrection with His ascension,<br />
Through the strength of<br />
His descent for the judgement of Doom.</p>
<p><!-- more --></p>
<p>I arise today<br />
Through the strength of the love of the Cherubim,<br />
In the obedience of angels,<br />
In the service of archangels,<br />
In the hope of the resurrection to meet with reward,<br />
In the prayers of patriarchs,<br />
In prediction of prophets,<br />
In preaching of apostles,<br />
In faith of confessors,<br />
In innocence of holy virgins,<br />
In deeds of righteous men.</p>
<p>I arise today<br />
Through the strength of heaven;<br />
Light of sun,<br />
Radiance of moon,<br />
Splendour of fire,<br />
Speed of lightning,<br />
Swiftness of wind,<br />
Depth of sea,<br />
Stability of earth,<br />
Firmness of rock.</p>
<p>I arise today<br />
Through God’s strength to pilot me:<br />
God’s might to uphold me,<br />
God’s wisdom to guide me,<br />
God’s eye to look before me,<br />
God’s ear to hear me,<br />
God’s word to speak to me,<br />
God’s hand to guard me,<br />
God’s way to lie before me,<br />
God’s shield to protect me,<br />
God’s host to save me,</p>
<p>From snares of devils,<br />
From temptation of vices,<br />
From every one who shall wish me ill,<br />
Afar and anear,<br />
Alone and in a multitude.<br />
I summon today all these powers<br />
between me and those evils,</p>
<p>Against every cruel merciless power that may oppose my body and soul,<br />
Against incantations of false prophets,<br />
Against black laws of pagandom,<br />
Against false laws of heretics,<br />
Against craft of idolatry,<br />
Against spells of women and smiths and wizards,<br />
Against every knowledge that corrupts man’s body and soul.</p>
<p>Christ to shield me today<br />
Against poising, against burning,<br />
Against drowning, against wounding,<br />
So there come to me abundance of reward.</p>
<p>Christ with me, Christ before me,<br />
Christ behind me,<br />
Christ in me, Christ beneath me,<br />
Christ above me,<br />
Christ on my right,<br />
Christ on my left,<br />
Christ when I lie down,<br />
Christ when I sit down,<br />
Christ when I arise,<br />
Christ in the heart of every man who thinks of me,<br />
Christ in the mouth of every one who speaks of me,<br />
Christ in the eye of every one who sees me,<br />
Christ in every ear that hears me.</p>
<p>I arise today<br />
Through a mighty strength,<br />
The invocation of the Trinity,<br />
Through belief in the threeness,<br />
Through confession of the oneness<br />
Of the Creator of Creation.</p>
