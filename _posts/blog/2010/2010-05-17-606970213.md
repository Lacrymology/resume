<img src="/assets/paschal-baylon.jpg" alt="Saint Paschal Baylon" style="float: right; padding-left: 1em;" /> Paschal, a Spanish saint, was born in 1540. From the time he was seven, he worked as a shepherd. He never had the opportunity to go to school. Yet he taught himself to read and write. He did this mainly by asking everyone he met to help him. He wanted to learn to read religious books. As he tended sheep each day, he would also spend his time praying. When he was twenty-four, Paschal became a Franciscan brother. Paschal was kind and easy to get along with. His companions liked him. They noticed that he often chose the hardest and most unpleasant chores. He was known for his spirit of penance. Yet he was a happy person. As a shepherd, Paschal had wished he could be in church, praying to Jesus. At that time he couldn’t. Now he could. He loved to keep Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament company. He considered it an honor to be a server at Mass. Brother Paschal’s two great loves were the Holy Eucharist and the Blessed Mother. Every day Paschal prayed the rosary with great love. He also wrote beautiful prayers to our heavenly Mother. Paschal made himself a little notebook out of some scraps of paper. In it, he wrote down some beautiful thoughts and prayers. After he died, his superior showed the little book to the archbishop. The archbishop read the book and said, ”These simple souls are stealing heaven from us!” Paschal died in 1592 at the age of fifty-two. He was proclaimed a saint by Pope Alexander VIII in 1690.
