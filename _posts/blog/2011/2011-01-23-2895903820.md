> Now is the time to try to find the courage to acknowledge to each other that throughout our histories, and even today, we are better at talking about love, justice, forgiveness, peace and equality, than we are at putting them into practice

&mdash; [Fr. Daniel Madigan, SJ](http://explore.georgetown.edu/people/dam76/?PageTemplateID=134). 23 Jan. 2011.
