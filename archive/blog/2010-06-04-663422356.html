<p><img src="/assets/saintf3v.jpg" alt="Saint Francis Caracciolo" style="float: right; padding-left: 1em;" /> Francis was born in the Abruzzi region of Italy on October 13, 1563. His father was a Neapolitan prince. His mother was related to the Aquino family to which the thirteenth-century saint, Thomas Aquinas, belonged. Francis had a good upbringing. He was active in sports. But when he was twenty-two, a disease similar to leprosy, brought him close to death. While he was sick, he thought about the emptiness of the pleasures of the world. He realized that real happiness could only be found in something deeper. Francis made a vow that if he got better, he would dedicate his life to God. He recuperated so quickly that it seemed like a miracle. Francis kept his promise. He began his studies to become a priest. After being ordained, Father Francis joined a group who were devoted to prison ministry. They cared for the prisoners and prepared condemned men to die reconciled to God. Francis and another priest, John Augustine Adorno, started a new religious congregation called the Minor Clerics Regular. When Father John died, Francis was chosen as the superior or leader of the group. He was not at all comfortable with this position. In fact, he was so humble that he actually signed his letters, ”Francis the sinner.” He also took his turn, along with the other priests, sweeping the floors, making beds and washing dishes. Father Francis often spent almost the whole night praying in church. He wanted all the priests to spend at least one hour a day in prayer before the Blessed Sacrament. Francis spoke so often and so well about God’s love for us that he became known as “the preacher of the love of God.” Francis did not live a long life. He died in June, 1608, at the age of forty-four. Just before he died, he suddenly cried, ”Let’s go!” ”Where do you want to go?” asked the priest by his bed. “To heaven! To heaven!” came the answer in a clear, happy voice. Francis Caracciolo was proclaimed a saint by Pope Pius VII in 1807.<br />
