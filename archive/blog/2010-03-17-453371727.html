<p>> "Awaked from his sleep of vice and sin," by a rooster which "alighted on his shoulder, and crowed three times," Blessed Torello of Poppi "became a poor brother, and almost a desert hermit ... without communicating with either his family or friends, he left that country and took his way toward the most desert and savage places of the mountains, wandering among them for eight days, and passing the night wherever it chanced to overtake him. But having at last come to a great rock, near a place called Avellanato, he remained there, adopting it for a cell eight days more, weeping for his sins, praying, and imploring God to pardon him; living all this time on three small loaves, which he had brought with him, and on wild herbs like the animals; and being much pleased with the place, he determined to make a cell under that great rock, and there spend all the days of this life, serving God with fasts, vigils, discipline, and prayers, and bitterly lamenting his past sins and evil life.<br />
&mdash; > Having taken this resolution, he went to his own country to put his affairs in order ... and selling all his goods, he gave the price to the poor, reserving to himself only a small sum of money to build a cell ... [and] enough land for a small garden."</p>
