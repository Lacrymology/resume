<p>Barbara was born in France in 1566. She was married to Peter Acarie, an aristocrat, when she was seventeen. She and her husband loved their Catholic faith and practiced it. The couple had six children, and their family life was happy. Barbara tried to be a good wife and mother. Her family learned from her a great love for prayer and works of charity. Once, when her husband was unjustly accused of a crime, Barbara herself saved him. She went to court, and, all alone, proved that he was not guilty. Although she was busy with her own family, Barbara always found time to feed those who were hungry. She instructed people in the faith. She helped the sick and dying. She gently encouraged people who were living sinfully to change their ways. The good deeds she performed were works of mercy. When her husband died, Barbara entered the Carmelite Order. She spent the last four years of her life as a nun. Her three daughters had become Carmelites, too. Barbaraâ€™s new name as a nun was Sister Marie of the Incarnation. She joyfully worked in the kitchen among the pots and pans. When her own daughter became the superior of the monastery, Sister Marie willingly obeyed her. She wanted to be humble, as Jesus was. Blessed Marie died in 1618. She was fifty-two years old.<br />
