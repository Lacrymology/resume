I met Michael in January 2007 when Ustrive2 was getting off the ground.  In my capacity as a consultant responsible for crafting business plans and raising seed capital, I had the good fortune of working closely with Michael as the ideas for distributive e-commerce were taking shape.  My experiences with programmers up till then had been less than satisfying.  Michael was a breath of fresh air.  He is personable, well-grounded, unique, responsible and a man of his word.  He has a keen business mind which I believe is one reason why his execution is so effective and elegant. I enjoyed working with Michael and would love to so again.
