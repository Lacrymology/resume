<p>> During Starkbierzeit, Muncheners sip earthenware steins of the dark, formidable suds to ward off winter's lingering chill &mdash; strong beer was originally concocted by 17th-century monks who drank it in place of solid food during Lent. The locals still call it their &quot;health tonic,&quot; and, keeping with tradition, celebrate and imbibe it during these late-winter weeks.</p>
