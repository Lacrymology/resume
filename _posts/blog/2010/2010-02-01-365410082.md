		Happy Feast of St. Brigid of Kildare!
> In our island of Hibernia Christ was made known to man by the very great miracles which He performed through the happy virgin of celestial life, famous for her merits through the whole world.
&mdash; St. Ultan, hymn honoring St. Brigid.
> O holy Brigid, you became sublime through your humility, and flew on the wings of your longing for God. When you arrived in the eternal City and appeared before your Divine Spouse, wearing the crown of virginity, you kept your promise to remember those who have recourse to you. You shower grace upon the world, and multiply miracles. Intercede with Christ our God that He may save our souls.
&mdash; Troparion (Tone 1) to St. Brigid of Kildare
