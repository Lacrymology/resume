<p>May 13th is the [Feast of Our Lady of Fatima](http://michael.f1337.us/post/593604855)! Join me in celebration and prayer, as I post the seven Fatima Prayers to Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr. Every hour, from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM EDT (GMT-4), I will post one of the prayers in whole or in part (see below), including a shortened "re-tweet-able" variation. Please feel free to repost, re-tweet and/or translate the prayers for your own friends and followers.</p>
