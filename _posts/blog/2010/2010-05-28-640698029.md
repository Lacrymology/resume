Mariana de Paredes y Flores was born at Quito, Ecuador, in 1618. At that time Ecuador was part of Peru. Mariana’s parents were Spanish nobles, but they died when she was a child. Mariana’s married sister took her into her home and raised her. From her early years, Mariana was drawn to a life of prayer. She chose to stay at home, doing humble chores and devoting her time to prayer and acts of penance. She placed herself under the guidance of a Jesuit priest. Mariana became known for her holiness of life. She had the gift of prophecy and worked miracles. In 1645, Quito was badly shaken by an earthquake. This was followed by an epidemic. Mariana offered her life to make up for the sins of the people of Quito. As soon as she made her offering, the epidemic came to an end. Mariana died on May 26 of the same year. The people of Ecuador lovingly call St. Mariana the “Lily of Quito.” She was canonized in 1950.
