<img src="/assets/stp32002.jpg" alt="Pope Saint Pius V" style="float: right; padding-left: 1em;" /> This holy pope was born in Italy in 1504. He was baptized Anthony Ghislieri. Anthony wanted to become a priest, but it seemed as though his dream would never come true. His parents were poor and didn’t have enough money to send him to school. One day, two Dominicans came to his home and met Anthony. They were so impressed with him that they offered to educate him. And so at the age of fourteen, Anthony joined the Dominican Order. That is when he took the new name “Michael.” Eventually, Michael became a priest. Then he became a bishop and cardinal. Cardinal Michael courageously defended the teachings of the Church against those who opposed them. He continued to live a life of penance. When he was sixty-one, he was chosen pope. Again he took a new name— Pius V. He had once been a poor shepherd boy. Now he was the head of the whole Catholic Church. But he remained as humble as ever. He still wore his white Dominican habit, the same old one he had always worn. And no one could persuade him to change it. Pope Pius V simplified the way things were done at the Vatican. He finished the new catechism of the Council of Trent and revised the prayer book used by priests and nuns every day and the missal used at Mass. He gave large sums of money to the poor, and personally visited hospitals and consoled the sick. Pope Pius V drew strength from the crucifix. He meditated every day on the sufferings and death of Jesus. He encouraged people to pray the rosary and established the feast of Our Lady of the Rosary. We celebrate it each year on October 7. Pope Pius V died in Rome on May 1, 1572. Pius V was proclaimed a saint by Pope Clement XI in 1712.
