<p>> **"HTML5 specification isn't yet ready due to interoperability."**</p>
<p>> How many times do we have to go over this? For the specification to be *ready*, it needs to be implemented fully in **two browsers**. I don't think this is going to happen either soon or otherwise.</p>
<p>> Case [in] point: CSS2.1. This specification is *not ready*. It's not implemented fully in any one browser. IE8 is missing one property and Opera (last I checked so I could be wrong) is missing two properties. That's the closest we get.</p>
<p>> If CSS2.1 *isn't ready* do we hold off using it in production? No.</p>

<p>Whole-heartedly agreed! Let's not forget X/HTML5 is supposed to be backwards-compatible. IMO, so long as we test for browser inconsistencies (which we already do), we can start progressively enhancing sites with HTML5. "Big bang adoption" of ANY new tech or process is going to be painful. But adopting a little at a time shouldn't be as painful as the FUD suggests.</p>
