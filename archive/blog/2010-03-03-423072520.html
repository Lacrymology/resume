<p>> I'm here as a Catholic Christian and an American citizen - in that order. Both of these identities are important. They don't need to conflict. They are not, however, the same thing. And they do not have the same weight. I love my country. I revere the genius of its founding documents and its public institutions. But no nation, not even the one I love, has a right to my allegiance, or my silence, in matters that belong to God or that undermine the dignity of the human persons He created.</p>
<p>&mdash; Archbishop Charles J. Chaput. "[The Vocation of Christians in American Public Life](http://www.archden.org/index.cfm/ID/3489)." Houston Baptist University. Houston, TX. 1 Mar. 2010. via @[MatthewWarner](http://twitter.com/MatthewWarner).</p>
