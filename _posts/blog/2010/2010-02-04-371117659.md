> Statesmen, my dear Sir, may plan and speculate for Liberty, but it is Religion and Morality alone, which can establish the Principles upon which Freedom can securely stand... The only foundation of a free Constitution, is pure Virtue, and if this cannot be inspired into our People, in a greater Measure, than they have it now, they may change their Rulers, and the forms of Government, but they will not obtain a lasting Liberty. They will only exchange Tyrants and Tyrannies.
&mdash; John Adams, [Letter to Zabdiel Adams](http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(dg004210))) (21 June 1776) via [Matthew Warner @ National Catholic Register](http://www.ncregister.com/blog/rethinking_the_power_we_give_government_part_2_of_2/)
