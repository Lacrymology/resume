Combine in a 30mL bottle:

* 40 drops [Cinnamon Leaf Essential Oil](https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/products/cinnamon-leaf-essential-oil/profile) (bark oil is toxic)
* 60 drops [Clove Bud Essential Oil](https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/products/clove-bud-essential-oil/profile) (read the precautions!)
* 60 drops ["Lemon Eucalyptus" (Eucalyptus Citriodora) Essential Oil](https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/products/eucalyptus-lemon-essential-oil/profile) or Eucalyptus Radiata Essential Oil (avoid eucalyptus globulus)
* 80 drops [Lemon Essential Oil](https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/products/lemon-essential-oil/profile)
* 40 drops [Rosemary Essential Oil](https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/products/rosemary-essential-oil/profile)
* 20 drops [Sage Essential Oil](https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/products/sage-common-essential-oil/profile)
* 40 drops [Ravensara Essential Oil](https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/products/ravensara-essential-oil/profile)
* (optional) 40-60 drops of any aromatic essential oil of your choosing. We have found [Lavender Essential Oil](https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/products/lavender-essential-oil/profile) to be effective at balancing the clove + citrus scent of the other oils.

â€¦then fill the bottle with a light [carrier oil](https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/catalog/ingredients/oils) of your choosing.
